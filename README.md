This model is trained on Fashion MNIST dataset.
The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 60,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, each representing one of 10 fashion categories like shirts, shoes, and bags. It is used as a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models in image classification tasks.
I have used Deep Learning and Convolution Layers in this Project. The accuracy was 83.73%.
Due To limited resources i have to limit the number of epoches else it may reach above 90%

### Fashion MNIST Classifier Using DNN

#### Technologies Used
1. Python
2. TensorFlow/Keras
3. Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

#### Techniques
This project involved building a deep neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 10 categories of clothing items. The architecture included multiple dense layers with ReLU activations, supplemented by dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

#### Learning Outcomes
1. Understood how to design and train a DNN from scratch.
2. Learned about dropout as a regularization technique.
3. Gained knowledge of model evaluation using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.

#### Results
1. Achieved an accuracy of 91% on the test set.
